\begin{abstract}
The aim of this document is to analyze the most relevant papers related to the research areas of door recognition and robotic vision. Promising work is \cite{7942676}: it fuses together a data-driven technique and a feature-based model to recognize door. This approach selects a ROI (region of interest) with a deep network and then applies an algorithm to extract the doors' characteristics only within this ROI. A possible way to increase the precision of the feature-based algorithm is explained in \cite{QUINTANA2018146}. Its feature-based algorithm is more complex and precise. In addition, this method fuses together visual and depth data. The survey reported in \cite{8683987} gives us useful information to utilize both RGB and depth data in an end-to-end module. Moreover, this work analyzes the available datasets that can be used to train a neural network to perform object recognition.
