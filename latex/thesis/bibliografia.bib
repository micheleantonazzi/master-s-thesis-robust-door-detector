Doors appear in almost every office-like indoor environment and they have to be crossed often during the navigation process. We present in this paper a new approach that uses visual information to anticipate that a door has to be crossed. Combining then visual information with ultrasonic sensors, the robot approaches the door until an adequate distance is reached. Door traversing is then performed using sonar sensors. This paper describes the control architecture and the behaviors that have been implemented to obtain the door traversing behavior. Results and performance issues are explained. The experiments have been carried out with a B21 mobile robot.}

	abstract="We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. SSD is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stages and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has competitive accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. For {\$}{\$}300 {\backslash}times 300{\$}{\$}300{\texttimes}300input, SSD achieves 74.3 {\%} mAP on VOC2007 test at 59 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for {\$}{\$}512 {\backslash}times 512{\$}{\$}512{\texttimes}512input, SSD achieves 76.9 {\%} mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy even with a smaller input image size. Code is available at https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd.",

	abstract = {Autonomous robots must be able to learn and maintain models of their environments. Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate metric maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are often difficult to learn and maintain in large-scale environments, particularly if momentary sensor data is highly ambiguous. This paper describes an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and naive Bayesian integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both paradigms, the approach presented here gains advantages from both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper gives results for autonomous exploration, mapping and operation of a mobile robot in populated multi-room environments.}
