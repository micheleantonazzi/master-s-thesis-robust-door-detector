 \section{Doors Detection}
 Mobile robots are active agents that operate interacting with real world. To successfully execute the assigned task, a mobile robot has to build an abstract model of the environment in which it operates. Considering indoor scenes, doors are crucial features that a robot can acquire to make its environment's model more informative. 
 Smart vacuum cleaners, healthcare robots or intelligent housekeepers helps people in their daily task. Usually, the tasks assigned these autonomous agents imply moving between rooms and dealing with doors.
 Doors detection can help these types of agents to safely navigate in indoor environments, by improving their reasoning abilities and navigation strategies.

    They have to perceive environmental features, build an abstract model of the real world, decide and plan future actions, and finally act to fulfill the assigned task. Operating in real world, autonomous agents operate in uncontrolled condition i Using sensors, an autonomous agent acquire data directly to the environment in order to build an abstract model of the real world in which it operates. (qui si potrebbe riportare qualcosa su laser, lidar ecc ma non centra molto con il nostro lavoro). Traditional sensors used in robotics, like ultrasonic sensor or LiDAR, converts physical signals (sound and light respectively) into distance measurements. An autonomous agent can aggregate these data using    information gets environmental characteristics using physical signals (sound or light respectively). Using this data, a mobile robot can and  To get an extensive representation of the environment, a mobile robot can acquire and analyze RGB frames from a camera.  in which  the robot operates 
 
 Mobile Robotics and Computer Vision are two disciplines that are growing rapidly in the recent years. Modern technologies and an intensive research activity have brought promising results in these fields.
 Nevertheless, Mobile Robotics and Computer Vision
